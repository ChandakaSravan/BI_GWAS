The code performs the following below tasks: 

Ran "python3 datasetGenerator.py --ID 1002059166" command in commandprompt to generate the CSV. After this implemented pyhton code in jupyter notebook. For clear understanding I've printed the rows of csv in jupyter notebook as well.

1) Imported the required libraries: pandas for data handling, fisher_exact from scipy.stats for calculating p-values, numpy for numerical computation, and matplotlib.pyplot for plotting. 

2) Reading a csv file named "1002059166.csv" using pd.read_csv method and storing it in the data dataframe. 

3) Initializing two lists p_values and significant to store the results. 

4) Iterating over each row in the dataframe, calculating the odds ratio and p-value for the SNP data using the fisher_exact function. The p-value is then appended to the p_values list. 

5) Storing the results in a new dataframe results, which includes columns for the SNP name, the calculated p-value, and a Boolean variable indicating whether the SNP is significant under the original p-value threshold (p-value < 5e-8). 

6) Printing the number of significant SNPs using the original p-value threshold. 

7) Writing the results to a csv file named "results.csv". 

8) Calculating the Bonferroni-corrected p-value by dividing the original p-value threshold (5e-8) by the number of SNPs, N. 

9) Determining the number of significant SNPs under the corrected p-value threshold. 

10) Writing the updated results to a csv file in the 4rth column. 

11) Plotting a Manhattan plot to visualize the results. The plot shows the -log10(p-value) for each SNP, with the original and corrected p-value thresholds indicated as red and green lines, respectively.

12) Referred to some websites to write the documentation in latex
